            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

conſider ſeriouſly, how all, confidently, conclude themſelves in the Right; back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Tenets with Scripture, Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Reaſon; and that moſt things they hold as Truths, to be but dubious, at beſt, unleſs he be a reſolute Perſon, not doubting at all in his Opinion and Sect. But if he waver, and be doubtful, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one Sect to another, have taken exceptions at the defects of moſt, 'tis a wonder if he fall not out with all, and fix on Atheiſm at laſt, and deſpiſe all Religion as a cheat, or policy to keep Men in good Order.</p>
                     <p>Another cauſe of Atheiſm, may be Peace and Plenty in a time when Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flouriſhes. For Proſperity has damn'd more Souls, than all the Devils in Hell; It makes Men caſt off fear of GOD, and Man; entangles Mens minds in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, blinds them in their pleaſures, and overwhelms them in Sin: For, whilſt we thrive in the World, we are apt to turn our backs on Heaven: whereas, Poverty, and afflictions are the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Providence, and the bleſſings of the Almighty, to fit Sinners for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, inclining our minds more to true
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65680:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Devotion, for the afflicted have God, for the moſt part, in their minds and mouthes.</p>
                     <p>An Habit of Scoffing, and deriding the Scriptures may be another cauſe. This Vain, Idle, and Phantaſtical, Pityful, Childiſh humour of Jeſting, proceeds (which this Age ſo Super-abounds with, among ſuch as call themſelves <hi>Gentlemen</hi>) from Pride and Oſtentation. For, they being, generally, Men of weak Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and unfit for matters of Subſtance, and Solidity, as being above their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; they, immediately, with a diſdainful Jeſt, ſcorn what they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of, or proceeds from any that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt noble things. Wit may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be uſed, GOD having given no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to us in vain; but great care ought to be had it be not abuſed, eſpecially in jeſting with Holy things; for thereby they make a mock of Sin, trifle with the wrath of GOD, and play, like Fools, with Hell-fire, whither, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, they are poſting. This way of fooling is beneath a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> for it Hebetates the Reaſon, and renders him empty, flaſhy, and Phantaſtical.</p>
                     <p>Another cauſe may be, the Clergy
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65680:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
live ſcandalouſly, which is a great eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore, and a main cauſe; what can be more unſeemly, than to ſee ſuch as ſhould lead men to Heaven, walk themſelves as if there were no Hell? That ſhould be Inſtructers of others in Sobriety, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and all Piety, live looſely, proudly, in all Riot, and Exceſs? Drinking, Whoring, Lying, Swearing, Pride, and Covetouſneſs, are odious in every one; but eſpecially in thoſe that ſhould teach otherwiſe, are they aggravated. Such are a diſhonour to their Coat, the ſcandal of the Church, and an occaſion of the Enemies Blaſpheming. Who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe are ſins, as they exclaim in the Pulpit, if they themſelves all the week after walk in them with delight?</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Gentleman,</hi> though he ſhou'd with much indignation abominate ſuch vile practices, and, if in power endeavour to ſuppreſs them; yet ſhou'd not be ſo narrow ſpirited, as therefore to neglect the Ordinances of GOD, ſince the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and Finiſher of our Faith, and Religion, Commands the very <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves to hear the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> thoſe whom he calls ſo often
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65680:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and againſt whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces ſo many woes; only with this Reſtriction, <hi>That they do not as they do;</hi> However, their Doctrine was good, and therefore enjoyned <hi>To do as they ſay.</hi> A Miniſter that has a Lawful Call, ought rather to be reprehended, than ſlighted. He may be evil himſelf, yet inſtruct others in good works.</p>
                     <p>Theſe make large Rents in the Church; Union, of all things elſe, ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired therefore. And why are there ſo many differences among us? Either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are wedded to our own wayes, and Opinions; or becauſe we quarrel with ſhadows, Order, Ceremonies, and things indifferent, and not of Faith, while we neglect the Subſtance, and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals in Religion. Many times, through weakneſs of Judgment, violent conteſts ariſe between party and party, and yet neither differ in the main, and perhaps, not in the thing it ſelf neither; which through their ignorance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they know not how to Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile. To Compoſe theſe Differences is by fair and gentle, not foul, and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous means, according to the Laws. A
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65680:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
weak Brother is to be reſtored in the Spirit of meekneſs. Conſciences are not to be compell'd by Fire and Sword: For, that Religion which is eſtabliſhed by the ſword, muſt needs bek in to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s, let the pretences be what they will, or worſe. As we have lately too wofully experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in our bleſſed times of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in which they did not ſtick, in their Zeal, to deſtroy the Lord's Anointed. If they had been men after Gods own heart, as they were Saints, their hearts would certainly have melted with ſorrow and remorſe, as <hi>David</hi>'s ſmote him for but cutting off the skirt of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet he never intended to cut his throat: But their hearts were hardned, if not ſeared. Nothing more unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> than to oppoſe his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, the fountain of Gentility; or Government, the Ordinance of GOD. Can any man be ſo ſtupid, as to imagine there can be any Religion in Rebellion, or Reformation in murthering of Kings, ſubverting of Government, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Families?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Innovations</hi> in Religion are dangerous, unleſs gradual, and by the ſteps of time;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65680:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for ſo they'l hardly be percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. No Innovation, unleſs by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of time, can ſuit well with any well-governed Nation; for long-continued Cuſtoms agree beſt together, although, perhaps, in themſelves bad; whereas better, being unuſed, link not ſo well, and therefore prove more troubleſome. So that great caution is to be had in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that the Alteration be for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and not the Reformation a pretence to Rebellion; which a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in all publick Conferences, Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and Counſels, ought carefully to avoid. Let all Diſcourſes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be without paſſion, bumbaſt words, or intricate ſpeeches, and with the greateſt mildneſs that may be. In all diſputes, that you may prevent prejudices in your Antagoniſt, gain eſteem in him, and avoid needleſs Diſcourſe; grant all you hear him propoſe, that you reaſonably can, and that may tend to the clearer detecting the Truth.</p>

                        <hi>Superſtition</hi> in Religion is worſe than down-right Atheiſm, and quite contrary to true Religion; <hi>Illorum pietas, mera im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietas:</hi> For 'tis the reproach of the

But Superſtition has been the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of many a flouriſhing Kingdom, Tyrannizing over the fancies, minds, and Reaſons of Men.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a wonderful thing to conſider how mens minds are naturally inclined to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, than which nothing is more unbecoming a <hi>Gentleman: Tot mundi Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiones, quot Coelo Stellae!</hi> The Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions of former times were innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Sacrifices, and Ceremonies, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Images of all matter, and adoring them when they had done, multiplying ſo many Rights, Torments, and Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as may well become the Devil to be the Author, and maintainer of them.

                        </hi> and what not?

                     </p>
                     <p>I can't better Characterize them, than
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65680:31"/>
thus; they are generally poſſeſt with madneſs, folly, pride, inſolency, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, ſingularity, peeviſhneſs, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, impudence, ſcorn, and contempt of all other Sects, perſwaſions, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, or that diſſent from their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, and Conjectures. They are only wiſe, only Learned in the Truth; All damn'd but they, and their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; And yet they torture the Scripture, and turn it like a noſe of Wax to their own ends, and purpoſes; Alwayes learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet never come to the knowledg of the Truth. And yet ſo wilful, and beſotted, ſay what you will ſay, 'tis all one, they care not, they will have their way, though all the World contradict them: Like vertiginous people, they think all goes round and irregular, when indeed the errour is in their own brains. They generally affect Novelties, and preferr Falſhood before Truth; and that which their folly and raſhneſs has once produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, with pride afterwards, frowardneſs, and contumacy, they maintain as long as they live, againſt all Reaſon, or Senſe.</p>
                     <p>In a word, this is common to all Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, there is nothing ſo bad and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65680:31"/>
abſurd, ridiculous, impoſſible, incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which they will not believe, obſerve, and diligently perform as much as in them lies. Nothing ſo monſtrous to conceive, or intollerable to put in practice, ſo cruel to ſuffer, which they will not willingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake: So powerful a thing is Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</p>
                     <p>Nothing, I ſay, is ſo unbecoming a <hi>Gentleman</hi> as Superſtition, whoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is the people; and in all Superſtition, therefore, wiſe men follow Fools: Beſides, in it ſelf, its odious and deformed, as well as ſtupid and ſottiſh, by how much the more it reſembles Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">How a Gentleman may be ſure to make choice of the true Religion.</note>Since every Religion, Sect, and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as was ſaid) is as confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and maintained by the profeſſors thereof, as the only true one; It is the part of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> eſpecially being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in good Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to examine all with impartiality, looking on his own with the ſame indifferency, as if he had never been therein inſtructed, that he may find out the truth of the Chriſtian Faith, and the main Articles of it; the Being, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65680:32"/>
of a GOD, and the conſequent Doctrines of Natural Divinity; and then the Truth and Authority of the <hi>Holy writ.</hi> And thus a Man ſhall be able indeed to give an account of his Faith. What can be more unſeemly, than to hear a <hi>Gentleman</hi> have no more to ſay for his Belief, than a <hi>Peſant,</hi> a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Pagan;</hi> that he was ſo taught, and all the Nation, and therefore he is of that belief?</p>
                     <p>Which that he may the clearer do, he muſt conſider, firſt, the Teſtimony, the Foundation on which Chriſtianity is built, viz. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> That he was ſent from GOD the Father, to manifeſt his will and counſel unto us. The truth of which when he hath cleared, the belief thereof will be Rational to him. Now, this Teſtimony of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Author, &amp; Finiſher of our faith, is given by no leſs than GOD himſelf; who though he be Omnipotent, <note n="ſ" place="margin">

among the Heathen a Deity has ever been acknowledged, as alſo that their gods were true.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>So that the Queſtion will be now, whether there be any credit to be given to the ſcriptures, that give ſuch ample teſtimony of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from GOD, or whether they are his <hi>revealed word,</hi> more than other Writings. Touching which I ſhall wholly lay aſide thoſe Arguments, from their Majeſtickneſs, and ſometimes plainneſs of ſtile; Their ſubject on which they treat, or the power and influence they have on Mens Conſciences, as Idle, frivolous, not ſufficiently evincing them to be <hi>Divine Oracles,</hi> or to proceed from the <hi>Holy Spirit:</hi> ſince our Conſciences eaſily conſent to what our belief is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt with in our Infancies. Beſides, if this be all, a <hi>Turk</hi> may plead as much for the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> in every reſpect, as we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65680:33"/>
                        <note place="margin">Whether the Old &amp; New Teſtaments be the Word of God.</note> can for the <hi>Bible.</hi> Neither doth the ſealing the Truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the blood of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs ſignifie any thing in this particular, ſince we daily ſee, <hi>Jews, Turks, Pagans, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, Sects</hi> of all ſorts, <hi>Venners gang, though in open Rebellion,</hi> and before that, the <hi>Regicides,</hi> dye as reſolutely, couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, with as much ſeeming aſſurance of their ſalvation, as the beſt Martyr of them all, in the affirmation and juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own belief and Deceits.</p>
                     <p>We muſt therefore endeavour to ground the Truth and Authority of <hi>Holy writ</hi> on more ſure and ſound Foundations. Which I ſhall here, at this time, a little attempt; notwithſtanding the uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cenſures of ignorant, angry, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-witted Zelots; accounting me, in Diſcourſes of this Nature, an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> or at leaſt one that contemns, or hath but little regard for, or to the <hi>Scripture;</hi> And all becauſe I have ſtill endeavoured to bring them to a Rational ground of their Faith. For although ſome things in Religion be beyond Reaſon, yet it is not againſt Reaſon, and moſt may be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65680:34"/>
made out by Reaſon. If this were not ſo, our belief would be very Implicite. I ſhall therefore endeavour to make it plain, that <hi>the Books</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtaments</hi> are the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and that upon the pure account of Reaſon only: For to go about to prove any ſuch thing to an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> by the Scripture, or any Argument deduced thence, is (when he believes no ſuch thing) to be ridiculous, and to prove a thing to be ſo, as Women do, becauſe it is ſo, and compel another mans Reaſon too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.</p>
                     <p>This, I hope, no <hi>Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Atheiſt</hi> will deny, that there is as much reaſon to believe the Hiſtory of the Old and New Teſtament, as any other, ſince there is the ſame Reaſon; firſt, to believe <hi>the Tradition</hi> of the Old and New Teſtaments, as the Tradition of any other. <hi>i. e.</hi> That there was ſuch a Man as <hi>Moſes,</hi> that wrote of the Creation, of the Patriarchs, of Gods Judgments on the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> of his delivering the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and leading them through the Wilderneſs. And after him, a <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who was their Captain and General in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65680:34"/>
their poſſeſſing <hi>the Land of Canaan.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Judges, Kings,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. that did ſuch and ſuch Acts. A <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and a <hi>John,</hi> that wrote ſuch things as they ſaw, and knew in their own times to be true, of one <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi> I ſay, we have as much reaſon to believe the Tradition of theſe Hiſtories, as any other Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: Or, as that there was an <hi>Homer,</hi> that wrote <hi>Illiads;</hi> a <hi>Virgil,</hi> his <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks;</hi> an <hi>Ovid,</hi> his <hi>Metamorphoſis;</hi> A <hi>Plato,</hi> an <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> or their Works.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, its as Rational to believe, that <hi>thoſe Books of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> were written by the ſame Men as are their reputed Authors; as to believe <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s, <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s, <hi>Tully</hi>'s, and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s works were theirs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that all that was delivered <hi>in the Old Teſtament,</hi> in <hi>Chriſts</hi> time, was true; appears by his frequent quoting of, and referring to it in his Diſcourſe, and Diſputes. Beſides, if it had been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, he would, no doubt, have taxt them with it, as well as for their <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Doctrines the Traditions of Men.</hi>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:65680:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And that 'tis the ſame we now have, and the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day acknowledge; and that 'twas never corrupted, is evident from the multitude of Copies diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after the firſt and ſecond Captivities, to every <hi>Synagogue,</hi> where they were diſperſed, in which they read every Sabbath-day. Now, how it ſhou'd be poſſible for Men, in almoſt all Nations, and at different times, to combine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in corrupting the <hi>Book of God,</hi> on deſign, let a prudent Man judge. But we find they do all agree; which they could never do, if any, and not all of them, ſhou'd have been corrupted. And, that they ſhou'd altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly, or caſually, be corrupted, when there appears no ſolid reaſon for ſuch a contrivance, ſeems more than improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To which add, if they were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, 'twould have been in thoſe places eſpecially which ſpeak, and Propheſie of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and againſt them. Beſides, if they were corrupted, they ſhou'd have corrupted the <hi>Septuagint Tranſlation,</hi> which was extant in <hi>Egypt</hi> three hundred years before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to make them agree. Again, if we obſerve it, we ſhall find
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65680:35"/>
more harmony between the Writers of the <hi>Divine Oracles,</hi> (though diſtant in time) than among any other Writers whatſoever. Laſtly, that the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which we acknowledge, is the ſame the <hi>Jews</hi> now receive, and alwayes did, may eaſily appear, by comparing our Copies and Tranſlations with the Originals among them in all Nations: Nor can it be thought that the Learned in all places, times, and of contrary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, <hi>Jews, Papiſts, Proteſtants,</hi> &amp;c. ſhou'd combine to deceive the giddy, and more unknowing ſort of people in the World.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, becauſe they wrote nothing but what was done in their own times, and known generally to all, who might have contradicted their Writings; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Goſpel</hi> were their Perſecutors; and wou'd, aſſuredly, have condemned them, had they been falſe, or liable to excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Nay, and <hi>Joſephus,</hi> though a <hi>Jew,</hi> yet an unbeliever in <hi>Chriſt</hi>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65680:36"/>
being accuſed by the chief of the people, was Condemned, and Crucified by <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> and the third day appeared to them again alive, as it was predicted of him by the <hi>Prophets. Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter, James, Paul,</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> have been continually reputed, and generally from Age to Age, down to theſe our times, confeſſed by all, to be the Pen-men of thoſe Books that bear their Names. Nay, this is acknowledged by the very <hi>Jews, Pagans,</hi> and even by <hi>Julian the Apoſtate.</hi> And therefore there is not only the ſame Reaſon to believe them as any other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; but as great Reaſon, if not greater, that their Writings are true; ſince what they wrote was only the paſſages or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their own times done by themſelves or others; which were eaſie to be known, being, moſt of them, done in publick, and they either Eye, or Ear-witneſſes, or both, of all paſſages: So that they had the greateſt opportunities in the World for detecting the Truth, and conſequently, beſt able to declare it. Beſides, the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men throughout the <hi>Bible</hi> were either Kings, Rulers, men of Honour, and high eſteem among the People; and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65680:36"/>
therefore would not atteſt lyes, to expoſe themſelves to the contradiction, and ſcorn of the World, or Vulgar: As <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, Samuel, David, Solomon, Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, Ezra,</hi> &amp;c. Or Prophets, <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Ezekiel,</hi> &amp;c. Or <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>Diſciples,</hi> Men of Integrity, Piety, and Fidelity, that could purchaſe nothing by that they delivered, if untrue; nay, for atteſting thoſe very truths, they incurred Impriſonment, Baniſhment, Perſecution, Poverty, and all kind of miſery; <hi>Wandring up and down in Sheep-skins, and Goat-skins, being deſtitute, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, tormented,</hi> &amp;c. They ſuffer'd for their profeſſion of the Truth more than any Men did. Beſides, they and their Doctrine was owned more eſpecially by GOD himſelf, in giving them <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Propheſie,</hi> the Inſpiration of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt;</hi> ſo that though illiterate, they could <hi>ſpeak all Languages,</hi> the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>working Miracles, Caſting out of Devils, Curing of Diſeaſes by even their very ſhadows,</hi> which was more than <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the fleſh did; and which the Magiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Conjurers of thoſe times could never do, though zealouſly attempted;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65680:37"/>
and therefore we have greater reaſon to believe their Writings, and them, than any other whatſoever. For none can be ſo impious, or irrational, as to think GOD would countenance, and give teſtimony to Impoſtures, and juggling tricks; and eſpecially ſuch as pretend to teach and lead Men into the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. This were (to ſpeak with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence) to make GOD acceſſary to the entrapping of mens Souls, and the deceiving the whole Chriſtian World.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Gentleman</hi> having thus laid a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Faith in the Being and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of a GOD: In his teſtimony of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Object, Author, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of our Faith; the truth and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Old and New Teſtament:</hi> and compared the profeſſion is made <hi>in the Church of England,</hi> with the vain Fopperies, Superſtitions, and Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>the Church of Rome;</hi> and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs to be found among them, and all <hi>Sectaries, Schiſmaticks, Phanaticks,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who condemn to Hell all that are not in their way; accounting all without their pale, damned: The irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and the abſurd

Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former, therefore, the latter ought to be limited; for a Man ſhall be found but able to bring both ends toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that makes his expences amount but to half his In-comes: what ſhall he do then whoſe Revenues are uncertain? It doth certainly concern him to be more than ordinarily ſaving, and prudent, ſo it be not imputed to baſeneſs; ſince he that thinks to lay up at the years end, muſt reduce his layings out to the third part of his comings in. If a <hi>Gentleman</hi> therefore will keep within compaſs, and avoid the many cheats of Servants, he muſt have an inſight, nay, a diligent eye into his own Eſtate; which is no diſgrace unto him, nor to the beſt Man living.

There is therefore nothing more unbecoming a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> nor nothing he ſhould with more caution avoid; for it ſets ſo ſweetly on him as he ſcarce ever perceiveth, or is ſenſible of his Malady.

Yet keep thy diſtance ſo, as thou mayſt be rather beloved, than ſlighted; and ſeem to walk rather humbly, than ſneakingly. Court eſpecially ſuch as are moſt likely to do you a kindneſs, without caſting more obligations on them than what are inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: For great perſons Love rather ſuch whom they have obliged, than ſuch as have obliged them; for they love not equall retributions by ſuch as are not their Equals; and ſo excite rather Shame or envy than love in them to their inferiours. Although Impudence, Confidence, and Boldneſs be no Virtues, yet the leaſt of theſe will beggar them all: The <hi>Italians</hi> have therefore a Proverb, that ſpeaks thus much in <hi>Engliſh: the World was made for the Preſumptuous.</hi>

                        <p>If a Favourite to a Prince, neither write, nor ſpeak his faults, nor, many times, what thou knoweſt of him to be true;

eſpecially if revealed unto thee as a ſecret; leſt by its coming to his eares thou beeſt ruin'd unawares; for ſuch men are more dangerous to be medled with, then Monarchs themſelves. Kings being above all envy, or puniſhment; but Favourites knowing they ſtand in a ſlippery place (as it is alwayes about the Throne) creates not only a jealouſie of all that can divulge their miſcarriages, but puts into them contrivances of miſchief againſt all ſuch, if not final deſtruction. 'Tis not ſafe therefore to be privy at all to their ſecrets. And whatever thou doſt, avoid all ſtrife with thy Superiours; putting thy hand to what is dangerous, and not juſtifiable; and making any great Mans Intereſt thine own, who has laviſht his Eſtate. Neither be perſwaded by them to forfeit thy Allegiance to thy King on any pretence whatſoever; which can't be without forfeiting a good Conſcience towards <hi>God,</hi> and, in moſt likely-hood, thy Soul to the Devil. Be not therefore ſo fickle-pated, to deſire changes in State; but ſatisfie thy ſelf with this, That Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is the care of Providence, not thine. If we rightly conſider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

of Kings, we need not envy them; they deſerving rather our pity, being, at the beſt, but miſerable; having but few things to acquire, or aim at, and many things to dread, and afflict them. But, ſince we have hinted at this before, it ſhall ſuffice.</p>

Avoid contentious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; but if thou canſt not avoid them, keep within moderation, and charge not farther than thou canſt make a ſafe, and honourable retreat; and in ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies 'twere not amiſs to reſolve thy Arguments into Queſtions, ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring to keep a reſerve within thy ſelf, that thou doſt not diſcover all thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that on juſt occaſion thou mayſt deliver rather more, than leſs than was expected, which will make thee the more

If a Droll; let him Droll on, and reflect not that on thy ſelf that was not intended towards thee; for ſo thou wilt not only make a Fool of thy ſelf, but him wiſe by thy application. If a Servant; perſwade, or command him; yet ſo, as thy Love to his good by amendment may be rather ſeen, than the venting thy Rage, which will never do good; for angry words, and Rage do but excite contempt in him, and hatred towards thee; it ought to be done then mildly, ſeaſonably, and gravely: And be ſure thy i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And, be not too ſcrupulous; for if a wiſe Man ſhould take notice of all the mad, and fooliſh Actions of moſt Men, he ſhould never be quiet; and ſo a wiſe Man would be rendred a Fool, miſerable, and unfortunate, and Fools would be more happy. Pay every Man his due, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grudging, or endeavours of abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſpecially when agreement was made before, or you know the worth of the thing.

'Tis the blow that never ſmarted, if rightly conſidered: For, if a Man have a Cabinet that every mans Key will open as well as his own, why ſhould he think to keep it private? The more he ſtirs in it then, the more he ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates his own miſery; for when all is done, it can never be redreſſed.

Thus a Man may live all his Life in the world without pleaſure, in ſolitude and miſery, there being no greater eaſe to a Mans Soul, Spirit, and Heart, then to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge its fulneſs by communicating his impriſon'd thoughts to a Friend, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Joys are revived, and increaſed; Sorrows and Troubles kill'd, and impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Beſides, by this Communication of thoughts, a man's own Intellect is not only bettered, but avoids ſplitting on the Rock of his own flattering thoughts; and arrives into the ſafe Haven of the good and impartial advice and Counſel of his Friend, both in Relation to his Affairs, &amp; Deportment.

                           <p>OF any the preceding <hi>non-naturals</hi> there is hardly one a <hi>Gentleman</hi> ſhould be more circumſpect in, than this of <hi>Reſt and Exerciſe;</hi> nothing being more pernitious to the Soul than Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 'Tis one of the ſeven deadly Sins, odious to <hi>God,</hi> and all good Men; eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mind and Soul as Ruſt doth Iron; the Devil's Cuſhion it is, and the Nurſe of all manner of Vice; neither is there any thing more deſtructive to the Body; for it weakens it, extinguiſheth Natural heat, hinders concoction and evacuation, cauſes oppilations, and fills the Body full of groſs, corrupt, excrementitious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; and is the Procatartick cauſe of all manner of Infirmities. For, as a ſtanding Pool corrupts, and breeds pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction, ſo doth our Body and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, being idle. And yet idleneſs is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65680:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
become the badge, as it were, or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing mark of Gentility, to be one of no Calling, not to Labour; for that's derogatory to their Birth; they make Vacation their Vocation. To be mere Spectators, Drones, to have no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary employment in their Generation, to ſpend their dayes in Hawking, Hunting, Drinking, Ranting, &amp;c. which are the ſole exerciſes almoſt of many of our Gentry, in which they are too immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. They know not how to ſpend their time (ſports excepted) what to do elſe, or otherwiſe how to beſtow themſelves. They do all by Miniſters and Servants, thinking it beneath them to look after their own buſineſs, till, many times, their Servants undo them, or at leaſt, enrich themſelves. Every Man hath ſome Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and 'tis not unbecoming a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> But they are all for paſtimes; 'tis moſt, if not all their ſtudy: All their wit and inventions tend to this alone, to paſs away their time in impertinencies, as if they were born, ſome of them, to no other end.</p>
                           <p>Oppoſite to this is <hi>Exerciſe, Labour, Diligence;</hi> which if in exceſs, on the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65680:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other hand, or unſeaſonably uſed, are as pernitious and deſtructive. A <hi>Gentleman,</hi> though never ſo great, has buſineſs enough, and labour too, if he rightly conſider. Beſides, exerciſes I am ſure they will have, good or bad, whatever comes on't. Therefore I ſhall ſhew how they are to be uſed, and which are the beſt. Violent Exerciſe and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſumes the Spirits, ſubſtantial parts of the Body, and ſuch humours as Nature would otherwiſe have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted; diverſly affect both the Body and Mind, hindring Digeſtion, ſometimes breaks the Veſſels, and frequently extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſateth the blood, cauſing Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the external parts, and skin envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roning the Ribbs, whence come Pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies: And, the blood thus irritated, if it remain ſtill in the Veins, excites putrid Fevers, and many other Maladies. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe at unſeaſonable times, as on a full ſtomack, is as bad: For it corrupts the Aliment in the ſtomack, and carries the Chyle crude and indigeſted into the veins; which there putrifying, deſtroys the health, and confounds the Animal Spirits. Likewiſe before evacuation by ſtool, that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65680:74"/>
the body be cleanſed from its Excrements 'tis unfitting. For when the Body is hot, and the pores open, their faeculencies are apt to be mixt with, and tranſported to, the good humours, and other parts. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to be uſed before concoction be, at leaſt, almoſt perfected. For the heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby evoked, concoction muſt needs be impedited, ill humours accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and divers infirmities ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
                           <p>A <hi>Gentleman</hi> is not only to obſerve the right uſing of exerciſe; But that he chuſe and uſe only thoſe that are good: moſt of their exerciſe is to eat, drink, lye down to ſleep, and riſe up to play; they think 'tis well, many of them, if they can but Hawk, Hunt, Ride an Horſe, play at Cards and Dice, Swagger, Drink, Drab, and take Tobacco with a grace; Sing, Dance, wear their Cloaths in Faſhion, Court and pleaſe the Ladies, talk great fuſtion, Inſult, Scorn, Strut, contemn and vilifie others, perhaps, their betters, and uſe a little mimical apiſh Complement above the ordinary cuſtom; they think themſelves compleat, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht, and well qualified <hi>Gentlemen.</hi>
                              <pb n="125" facs="tcp:65680:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Theſe are moſt of their imployments. This their greateſt commendation. I am not againſt theſe Recreations, if rightly uſed; however,</p>
                           <p>A <hi>Gentlemans</hi> Recreations are of two ſorts; either <hi>within,</hi> or <hi>without doors;</hi> to refreſh his ſpirits, entertain a Friend, exhilarate the mind; to aleriate time, tedious otherwiſe in thoſe long ſolitary Winter Nights, by certain games; the beſt of which may be abuſed, and are too often, by ſome that call themſelves <hi>Gentlemen;</hi> ſo that many are undone by it, and their Poſterity beggar'd, being led thereunto merely for filthy Lucre; whence alſo ariſe coſening, wrangling, ſwearing, drinking, lying, loſs of time, no good in the end, and, frequently, Ruine. For when once they have gotten an habit of Gaming; they can hardly leave it.</p>

This is very unſeemly in a <hi>Gentleman.</hi> Some mens whole delight, as well as Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is <hi>To take Tobacco, Drink all Day long, and Night too, in a Tavern, to diſcourſe of impertinencies, and that tend to no Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to Jeſt, Sing and Roar:</hi> This is a moſt ſordid Life for a <hi>Gentleman.

                              <p>PEripatetick Philoſophy is not herein to be followed. <hi>Admiration</hi> is, on the firſt rancounter of an object, a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſurprize of the Soul, cauſing a ſerious conſideration of the object, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rare or different from what ſhe knew before, or ſuppoſed it ſhould be, and then we admire it. <note place="margin">Aſtoniſhment, Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</note>If it be in exceſs, 'tis <hi>Aſtoniſhment.</hi> And according as we more or leſs admire the object, is <hi>Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>Contempt,</hi> which is only our opinion of the object, and are ſorts of <hi>Admiration;</hi> inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as if the object be not admired, there is no reckoning made of it more than Reaſon dictates. But if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65680:84"/>
from Love or Hatred, as ſometimes they do, and often may, the object is conſidered, as we have more or leſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to it.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <note place="margin">Magnanimity, Pride, Humility, Dejection.</note>And indeed, <hi>Eſtimation</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> may generally relate to all kind of objects. And ſo we may either Eſteem, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn our ſelves: and then the motion of the Spirits occaſioning them is ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that it cauſeth a mutation, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the countenance, but even in the very Actions, Gate, and Deportment, whence ariſe <hi>Magnanimity, Pride,</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> or <hi>Dejection.</hi> Which in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, from Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, become Habits. And truly, if we right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, 'tis no abſurdity for a Man to eſteem himſelf; for he that is wiſe will do it. But then, he muſt be one that has an abſolute command over his Will, and a free Diſpoſition; for only the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions thereon depending may be juſtly prais'd, or blamed; eſteemed, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. And thus we become Maſters of our ſelves when we have the free diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of our Wills, and ſo become tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Generous and Magnanimous, as that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65680:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we may ſet our ſelves at the higheſt rate we juſtly may if we rule our Wills well: But if ill, it can never be. He that hath attained to this free diſpoſition of his Will, will never contemn, nor blame another. For all faults in others, he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extenuates and excuſes, than aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates and condemns; as believing they proceed rather from ignorance, than good will. And although he think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no ways Inferiour to thoſe of far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Eſtate, Honour, Knowledge, Wit, &amp;c. So on the other ſide, he doth not eſteem himſelf much above his Inferiours. For all theſe things, in compariſon of his good will, he values but as trifles, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that for which he eſteems himſelf, is, or may be in every one. Nay, he is the moſt humble of any Man, for the ſame Reaſon; ſince by Reflecting on his former faults, and thoſe he is like to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit are no ways inferiour to others: He prefers not himſelf before any body, but concludes others that have this free Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, may uſe it as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                              <p>This is <hi>the truly Generous Perſon,</hi> and moſt likely to Maſter his Paſſions, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65680:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inclined to do great things, as ſhall be ſhewed beneath. <note n="d" place="margin">In Paſſions Rectified.</note> He that eſteems him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for ought elſe than for this free diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Will, is not really Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous, nor has true Generoſity, but only Pride, which is a Vice, the other a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ariſing chiefly of flattery; whence Men become proud, oft-times, for things that deſerve not any praiſe, but rather the contrary; ſo that, moſt frequently, we find the moſt ſtupid ſort of People fall thereinto.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Dejection</hi> is a vitious Humility, and as much unbecoming a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> as Pride. And is Diametrically oppoſite to Generoſity. For, as Pride enſlaves a Man to his deſires, his Soul muſt needs be perpetually perturbed with Anger, Hatred, Revenge, Envy, and Jealouſie. So, Dejection impoveriſhes the Spirits of Men; yet ſuch become, moſt commonly, arrogant and proud, ſhamefully at other times debaſing themſelves, and ſneaking to ſuch as they fear, or may get by, and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over ſuch from whom they neither hope, nor fear any thing. In proſperity they are as much elevated, as in adverſity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt: When as a generous, free, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65680:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Virtuous Soul is ſtill one and the ſame.</p>
                              <p>Another branch of <hi>Eſtimation,</hi> when we regard an object as able to do good or hurt, is <hi>Veneration;</hi> and of contempt, <hi>Diſdain.</hi> The motion of the Spirits that excites Veneration is compounded of that which excites Admiration, and Fear, beneath ſpoken of. Thoſe that excite Diſdain, of thoſe that excite Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity or boldneſs as well as Admiration. <hi>Veneration</hi> is an inclination of the Soul, not only to eſteem the object it reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, but alſo to ſubmit to it with ſome kind of fear, and to endeavour to make it become gracious to her. <note place="margin">Veneration and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</note>Our Love and Devotion is only to thoſe from whom we expect good; our Veneration to free cauſes only, which we apprehend are able to do good or evil to us. <hi>Diſdain</hi> is an inclination of the Soul to contemn a free cauſe, though it can do both good and evil; yet eſteemed ſo far beneath him, that he fears neither.</p>
                              <p>Thus much ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken, briefly, of the firſt Paſſion, <hi>Admiration;</hi> whoſe cauſe is in the Brain, and not in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65680:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Heart, or Spleen, Liver, Blood, &amp;c. Though the other Paſſions are in them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as well as in the Brain. For the knowledge of the thing admired is only in the Brain, and not in the Heart, Liver, Blood, &amp;c. on which depends all the good of the Body. It has no contrary, in that if the object don't ſurpriſe a Man, he conſiders it without paſſion, being not at all moved. And, in that he admires nothing but what ſeems rare, 'tis a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Paſſion, making him not only to apprehend, but remember things he was before ignorant of, the Idea thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by ſome paſſion or other, impreſt in his Brain, or applyed by his Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. But, if it be in exceſs, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we are apt to admire too much, 'tis not only very unbecoming a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> but alſo it doth much hurt, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the uſe of Reaſon. And if we admire nothing but what differs from that we knew before, or ſeems rare, this paſſion muſt needs be an effect of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in that nothing can ſeem ſo unto us unleſs we were ignorant of it. The more ingenious, and wittieſt of Men, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, eſpecially if they diſtruſt their own
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65680:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>

And ſo 'tis different from <hi>Deſire,</hi> which is a Paſſion apart. <hi>Hatred,</hi> on the contrary, is an emotion of the Spirits, which incite the Soul to Will to be freed and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65680:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from objects repreſented to be hurtful or evil.</p>
                              <p>In <hi>Love,</hi> the motions of the Blood and Spirits (if not joyned with Deſire, Joy, or Sadneſs, &amp;c. but ſimple and alone) are even, as alſo the pulſe, but greater and ſtronger than ordinary; emitting more heat, and Celeritating Digeſtion, and therefore is an Healthy Paſſion. But, in <hi>Hatred</hi> the Pulſe is uneven, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile and quick, cold inſtead of heat, or mixt with pungent heats in the breaſt ſometimes, concoction impedited, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits excited, and the humours become corrupted, or at leaſt vitiated; and ſo is a very noxious, and unhealthy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                              <p>This proceeds from the tye that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul &amp; the Body; as, when any corporeal action is joyned with a thought, one ſtill accompanies the other: As is apparent in ſuch who have an averſion to ſome Medicine, they cannot think on it, but the taſte, ſmell, &amp;c, comes alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into their thought.

And thus theſe ſame Spirits, being, from the Brain, tranſmitted to the Nerves, may expel the blood from the Spleen, and the ſmall Veins of the Liver, to the Heart, to hinder the noxious ſucc from entring; and move to thoſe which might repel this juice to the intrails and the ſtomack, or ſometimes to cauſe the Stomack to eject it: whence theſe

'Tis the worſt of Vices, ſubjecting all other affections, nay, even the ſevereſt Love, not ſparing the Life of the deareſt Friend when provok'd. Beſides, 'tis the effect of Pride; for by how much the more a Man values himſelf, by ſo much the more he reſents an Injury, and excites his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Nay, 'tis a kind of baſeneſs, and puſillanimity, and ſo, beneath a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> For we ſee ſuch as are weak, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Aged, or elſe Children, Fools, and Women moſt addicted to it. Men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> ſhould vent their Anger rather with ſcorn than fear, that they may ſeem to be rather above, than below the Injury. To get meekneſs, a calmneſs of Spirit, is an excellent Antidote, and directly oppoſite to it, and advances a Mans Honour. Patience and Humility are likewiſe good to ſuppreſs it. Reſiſt the firſt
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65680:112"/>
Aſſaults, or occaſions of it. Conſider what a madneſs 'tis, how it robs a Man of Reaſon, and leaves him naked to be laught at by every Coxcomb, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a Mans Life by its effects: The beſt time to ponder it well, is, when thy Rage is paſt. As tenderneſs, curioſity, and niceneſs, as alſo a bad conſtruction of the Action, miſapprehended and aggravated, and joyned with contempt, oft-times, with ſelf-love, are the cauſes of Anger, they muſt be counter-poyſed with Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Curioſity, then, muſt be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for he that will have every thing neat and to a punctillio, ſhall never have qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs, but be in continual wrath. Expect therefore from the beſt carriages of Friends, Servants, and Children, as well as Enemies, miſcarriages, and let them paſs. For, to be angry upon a fault, and, it may be, a ſmall one, is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a greater. As the beſt Actions of our beſt Friends and Relations, if miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehended, applyed, and aggravated, may often cauſe Anger; So the worſt Actions and Words of our greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies cannot move us, if we move not our ſelves. As the great conceit we have
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65680:113"/>
of our ſelves makes us think none ſhould touch us; So a meek Spirit would keep any injury from faſtening on us. As a <hi>Gentlemans</hi> Anger againſt his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, is arrogancy, madneſs, and folly; againſt his Equals, an hazzard: So againſt his Inferiours, 'tis baſeneſs. If the injury be from a Child, or an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Perſon, 'tis beneath thy notice. From a Droll, let him Droll on in his folly; perhaps, his words come not from him with reflection, reflect them not on thy ſelf. By making him wiſe by thy application, thou makeſt thy ſelf a Fool. If from a Wiſe Man, rather diſtruſt thy own Judgment; From a good man, believe not thou art injured; From a Servant, perſwade, or Command him; From a Wife, convince her with mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or bear with her; From a ſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Perſon, wonder not, much leſs be Angry; but rather paſs it with contempt. And truly, thou ſhouldeſt avoid the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of all, couldeſt thou but think ſeriouſly how advantagious ſuch an one with whom thou art Angry may be unto thee hereafter. For, to begin ſtrife is more eaſie, than to appeaſe it. As
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65680:113"/>
Offences are better Redeemed by merit, than requited with wrath; ſo clemency, and pardon, oft-times, converts an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into a perfect Friend. Since the Quarrel ceaſeth, then, when Anger is but on one ſide, lets requite good for evil: for he that is patient ſhall be ſure to overcome; which is the beſt and Nobleſt way of Conqueſt. But to be Angry with ſuch as can neither be overcome, nor won by it, is a madneſs as well as folly. Let him that will be truly generous and magnanimous, reſolve nothing ſhall move him, whatever happens: For, ſhould a wiſe Man take notice of, or be concerned at every mad, and fooliſh Action of moſt Men, he would never be at reſt, but render himſelf unfortunate, and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and thus a Fool would be more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than a wiſe Man. Yet he that's truly wiſe has nothing befalls him, but what he expected. To which add, whoſoever thinks himſelf contemned by another, looks on himſelf as his Inferiour: He muſt impute it rather to indiſcretion, ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs, want of breeding, &amp;c. or any thing elſe, than to contempt: For, ſince a great and generous mind becomes
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65680:114"/>
a great Fortune, the moſt glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is, for a <hi>Gentleman</hi> to Conquer himſelf, and not be moved by another. And, as ſuch who are in any high degree of Honour, ought to have the motion of their Paſſions more remiſs, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, inaſmuch as their Actions are of greateſt importance, and, conſequently, their faults hardlieſt repair'd, or palliated: So moderation, the Spirit of clemency, and mildneſs, adds a grace and luſtre to him that bears them, and alſo pleaſure, acceptation, and love of all the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
                              <p>Thus, were we careful, circumſpect, and wiſe, we may eaſily ſubdue, and over-rule our Paſſions; or, at leaſt, bridle their exceſs, and avoid the ill uſe of them (for they are Naturally all good) by oppoſing the will, following the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Repugnant to thoſe the Paſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents and ſubjects, ſo ſhall we be Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers over them, or at leaſt ſo order them, as their evils may eaſily be endured, and reap Joy and benefit from the worſt of them.

            <p>COncerning our Lives, I muſt needs ſay, and ſo it will appear, if we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider all things, 'tis but a fools Paradiſe, and the World but a great <hi>Bedlam,</hi> or a common Priſon of Gulls, Cheats, Flatterers. All conditions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Heavens, from the higheſt to the loweſt, are out of Tune. As in <hi>Cebes</hi> Table, <hi>Omnes errorem bibunt.</hi> Before we came into the World we were Intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with errours Cup, and all our Lives
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65680:127"/>
long macerated, and direfully cruciated with Anger, Fear, Sorrow, Envy, Diſcontent, and the reſt of thoſe horrid Paſſions before ſpoken of. Nay, all our dayes are ſorrow, our Travel grief, and our Heart taketh no reſt in the Night, as the wiſe Man notes. And the Hearts of the Sons of Men are evil, and madneſs is in their hearts while they live; nay, even the wiſeſt. In the multitude of Wiſdom is much grief, and he that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth Knowledge, increaſeth ſorrow. All is ſorrow, grief, vanity, and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit, in the World; the Wiſeſt Man, <hi>Solomon,</hi> will not juſtifie his own Actions. <hi>Surely</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>I am more fooliſh then any Man, and have not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of a Man in me.</hi> Nothing pleaſed him, he hated his Labour and Life it ſelf. Impudence, Folly, and Fortune, (that care not what they do, or ſay) ſhall Rule more in the World, then Virtue or Wiſdom, which oft-times give way; whence honeſt and wiſe men are termed Fools. How ordinary is it, for ſuch as cannot, or will not Lye, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, Shift, Flatter, Temporize, as others do, but are honeſt, and plain-dealing,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65680:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be accounted Ideots, Aſſes, and no better then fools. Again, if the Philoſophers that gave Precepts of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to others, Inventers of Arts and Sciences, the ſeven Wiſe Men of <hi>Greece,</hi> be fools, as <hi>Lactantius,</hi> in his Book of Wiſdome, proves them Dizzards, Aſſes, and Mad-men, ſo full of abſurd, and ridiculous tenets, and brain-ſick poſitions; that, to his thinking, never any old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or ſick Perſon doted worſe; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> took all from <hi>Leucippus,</hi> and left the Inheritance of his folly to <hi>Epicurus:</hi> He makes no difference between <hi>Plato, Xenophon, Ariſtippus, Ariſtotle,</hi> and the reſt, and Beaſts, ſaving that they could ſpeak: If, I ſay, theſe men had no more Brains then ſo many Beetles, what ſhall we think of the commonalty, and the major part, if not of the whole World? <hi>Supputius</hi> Travelled all over <hi>Europe,</hi> to find, and confer with a wiſe man; but returned, at laſt, without his Errand. <hi>Cardan</hi> thinks few men are well in their wits. And <hi>Tully</hi> concludes every thing to be done fooliſhly, and unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly. All dote, but not in the ſame kind, not alike; one is proud, another
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65680:128"/>
ambitious, a third envious, a fourth avaritious, a fifth poring ever in a Book, or writing Books, a ſixth laſcivious, a ſeventh given to Wine, &amp;c. The whole courſe of our Life is, indeed, but matter of Laughter; no difference between us and Children; <hi>Majora Ludimus, &amp; grandioribus pupis;</hi> They play with Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, and we with greater bables; 'tis the ſame thing.</p>

He told him, he ſaw a promiſcuous multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, whoſe Habitations were like Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills, they like Emmets; and Cities like ſo many Hives of Bees, and every Bee had a ſting, and did nothing but ſting one another. Some domineering, like Hornets, greater then the reſt; ſome like filching Waſps, others as Drones. Over their heads hung a confuſed company of perturbations, anger, fears, ſorrows, cares, anxieties, hope, ignorance, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, Envy, avarice, revenge, &amp;c. And innumerable Diſeaſes, which by
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65680:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the hooks of Diſorder they were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pulling on their own Heads.

Their Towns, and Provinces were factious; Rich againſt Poor, and Poor againſt Rich. And ſo, condemn'd them all for Fools, Ideots, Aſſes.</p>
            <p>The meditation of mans Life made <hi>Heraclitus</hi> Cry and weep continually, to ſee its Madneſs: And <hi>Democritus,</hi> contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to Laugh at the folly of it. The World alters every day; we change our Language, Habits, Laws, Cuſtomes, Manners; but not Vices, not Diſeaſes, nor the Symptoms of folly, they are the ſame ſtill. All is out of Order. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi> make Laws againſt Thieves, and yet are the greateſt Thieves themſelves. <hi>Princes</hi> commend a private Life; private Men itch for Honour. <hi>Judges</hi> give Judgment according to their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and Juries, as they are bribed; wronging poor Innocents, to pleaſe others. <hi>Attorneys</hi> alter Sentences, and for money loſe their deeds. Some abuſe
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65680:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heir Parents, yea, corrupt their own Siſters; ſome rob one, ſome another. Some prank up their Bodies, and have their minds full of execrable Vices. Who is free from Avarice, Envy, Malice, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous Villanies, Mutinies, Unſatiable Deſires, Conſpiracies, Diſſimulation, Hypocricy, and other incurable Vices; bearing deadly hatred to one another, and yet covering it with a plauſible face? Some trot about to bear falſe-witneſs, and ſay any thing for money. There is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any Truth or Juſtice to be found among Men. For, they plead daily one againſt another; Son againſt Father and Mother, Brother againſt Brother. Kindred, and Friends of the ſame Quality, of one Profeſſion, cannot agree; they are vie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for place, Apparel, &amp;c. And all this for Riches, or vain Honour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, after Death, they cannot be poſſeſſors. And yet, notwithſtanding, for this they will defame, kill one another, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all unlawful Actions, contemning GOD and Man, Friend and Countrey. Some kill themſelves, deſpair not obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their deſires. How many ſtrange Humours are in Men? Some empty of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65680:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all Virtuous Actions, violently hunting after Riches, and to be favoured of Men, and take infinite pains for a little glory, having no end of ambition. When they are in Peace, they deſire War; depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Kings, and raiſing others in their ſtead: murdering ſome Men, to get Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their Wives. When they are poor, they ſeek wealth, and when they have it enjoy it not, but hoord it up, or ſpend it extravagantly; whereas, if men would but conſider <hi>the</hi> viciſſitude of things, and the mutability of this World, how it wheels about, there being nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, firm, or ſure, they would be much wiſer.

If, I ſay, we would attempt no more then what we can bear, we ſhould lead contented Lives; and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know our ſelves, limit our ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Imitators of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Much talk, much knowledge, much hearing of Sermons, but little Conſcience, and leſs practice. What variety of Sects! &amp;c.

            <p>What ſtreams of Blood have been in the World, able to turn Mills! Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſlain at once; many bloody Battels to make ſome Prince ſport, without any juſt cauſe, for vain Titles, Precedency, ſome Wench, or ſuch like toy; or out of vain-glory, malice, revenge, folly, &amp;c.

At the Siege of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> 120000. And in this beaſtial folly, 'tis very common for the Son to fight againſt the Father, and Brother againſt Brother, Chriſtians againſt Chriſtians. What depopulations of Countreys, Deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Sacking, and Ruinating flouriſhing Cities, conſuming of Treaſure, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Towns, deflouring of Maids, and Women, perhaps, by thoſe that but juſt before ſlew their Husbands; and whatſoever elſe, miſery, miſchief, Hell it ſelf, the Devil, Fury, and Rage can invent, to their own Ruine and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo abominable a thing is War. 'Tis Gods ſcourge. In the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, betwixt the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> an hundred thouſand Men were ſlain, and ten thouſand Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies rooted out.

And that Name of Honour, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Applauſe, laſts not neither; 'tis but a mere flaſh, this Fame.</p>
            <p>In moſt places one is rewarded, and raiſed, perhaps, to Honours, for which another ſhould have hung in Chains. A poor Man ſhall be hang'd for ſtealing a Sheep, when, it may be, compell'd by neceſſity, for the preſervation of his own, as well as Wives, and Childrens lives: when as a great man in Office may ſafely rob the whole Nation, undo thouſands, enrich himſelf by the ſpoil of others, and at laſt be Rewarded with Turgent Honours; and no Man muſt dare to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of him, or it. How many <hi>Cryſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides</hi> have we?

            <p>Every one is for his own private ends; no Charity, Love, Friendſhip, fear of God, Alliance, Affinity, Conſanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Chriſtianity, can check them; but if they be any wayes offended, or the ſtring of commodity touched, they preſently fall foul; old friendſhip is turned into enmity, for toys, oft-times, and trifles, ſmall offences; <hi>Dea moneta</hi> is the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of the World, and whom they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore; they Sacrifice to her. For by her men are raiſed, depreſſed, elevated, eſteemed; the ſole commandreſs ſhe is of their Actions; for which they pray, run, ride, go, come, labour, and contend. 'Tis not Worth, Virtue, Wiſdom,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65680:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Valour, Learning, Honeſty, Religion, or any ſufficiency, for which men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in this World; But for money, greatneſs, Authority, Office; Honeſty is accounted folly. Knavery, Policy, and Wiſdome. Such ſhifting, lying, cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, plotting, counter-plotting, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing, flattering, cozening, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling! that, of neceſſity, one muſt high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offend God, if he be conformable to the World: or elſe he muſt live in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, diſgrace, and miſery all his Life. What difference between words and deeds, the Tongue and Heart? How common is it for a Scholar to crouch to an illiterate Peſant, for a meals meat? A Scrivener better payed for a Bond, or Bill, then a Student? A Lawyer get more in a day, then a Philoſopher in a year? Better rewarded for an hour, then a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar for a twelve moneths ſtudy. If we have any bodily Diſeaſe, we ſend for the <hi>Phyſitian;</hi> but of the diſeaſes of the mind we take no notice. Luſts torment us on one ſide; Envy, Anger, Ambition, &amp;c. on the other; we are torn in pieces by our Paſſions: one in diſpoſition, the other in Habit. But the miſery is, we ſeek for no

Cure. Every man thinks with himſelf, I am well, I am wiſe, laughs at others; when, indeed, all fools. But, now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, we have Women Polititians; Children Metaphyſitians. Every ſilly fellow can ſquare a Circle, make perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual motions, find out the Philoſophers Stone, interpret the Revelation, make new Theoricks, new Logick, new Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, a new Body of Phyſick, a new Syſtem of the World. For one Virtue, notwithſtanding, you ſhall find ten Vices in any individual Perſon on Earth. A wiſe man is a great wonder.</p>
            <p>Our Life is but a ſpan, or hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadth, as <hi>David</hi> declares.

The King, as well as the Peſant; The Philoſopher, as well as the Dunce; The Noble, as well as the baſe.

Man is full of miſeries; miſeries of Soul, of Body; while he ſleeps, wakes, whatever he doth, or wherever he turns; as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> well notes. Great travel is Created for all men, and an heavy yoak on the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> from the day that they came out of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb, unto that day they return unto the Mother of all things: namely, their thoughts, and fear of their hearts,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65680:134"/>
and their Imagination of things they wait for, and the day of Death, from him that ſitteth on the glorious Throne, to him that ſitteth beneath on the Earth; from him that's cloathed in blew ſilk, and weareth a Crown, to him that's cloathed in ſimple Linnen: wrath, envy, trouble, and unquietneſs, and fear of Death, and rigour, and ſtrife; and ſuch things come to both man and Beaſt; but ſeven-fold to the ungodly.

care and ſollicitude. To Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Riot, Diſeaſes, and Infirmities.

A prepoſterous way of Reformation, to put the Soul into ſuch fatal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſities of ſinning, as it muſt be here in this World. This muſt needs be the direct courſe to Ruine it, and caſt it on a fatal neceſſity of periſhing, eſpecially if caſt on ſuch times and places as are over-run with Barbariſm, and Vice. If our conditions of Recovery be ſo near impoſſibility, our State is as bad as the Devils; and if the non-performance of theſe conditions be puniſht with greater penalties, 'tis worſe; Better be abandoned to eternal Deſpair, then have hopes to be Reſcued by ſuch means only as, 'tis ten thouſand to one but, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly increaſe our torment and miſery.</note> formerly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

Why did I not give up the Ghoſt when I came out of the Belly? Why did the Knees prevent me, or the Breaſts, that I ſhould ſuck?

            <p>In a word, 'tis a miſery to be born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this wretched World, a pain to live, and a trouble to dye. For the Lives of the beſt men, you ſee, are ſtuff'd with vexation, miſchief, and trouble.

            <p>KIng of Terrours and Fears, 'tis ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where called. But, me-thinks, ſince it frees us of ſuch a miſerable world, ſuch a miſerable Life, it ſhould not ſeem ſo terrible. <hi>Stultum eſt timere quod vita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri non poteſt;</hi> 'Tis a folly to fear what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided, as Death.</p>
            <p>Death frees us, I ſay, of all our cares, fears, anxieties, troubles, miſeries, Enemies, and yet we abhor it, and will not conſider our folly.</p>
            <p>Who is more free from care, than he that ſleeps? Death is but a long ſleep, and if we dye well, it will, without doubt, be a ſweet one.</p>
            <pb n="232" facs="tcp:65680:136"/>
            <p>Me-thinks the conſiderations of our unhappy Lives ſhould induce us rather to meet, or purſue, then ſhun, or flye from Death; and account it rather our Friend, then Enemy; ſince it openeth the Door to fame, and extinguiſheth Envy.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Debt we owe to Nature, and ſo, 'tis but Reaſon and Honeſty to pay it; That's the beſt time, when a man has made his peace with GOD, and all the World, and hath atchieved worthy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations and ends, has been beneficial, and helpful to others in his Generation, and done Noble Acts, or ſuch as have been praiſe-worthy.</p>
            <p>The fear of Death is worſe than Death it ſelf, and is augmented with dreadful Stories; when indeed, 'tis nothing ſo painful as they make it; the vital parts being not the ſenſibleſt. How many dye away ſo ſweetly, and without noiſe, though ſenſible, as if they only fell aſleep?</p>
            <p>'Tis but a weak Opinion, therefore, makes us fear it. For there can be no Reaſon to fear it, ſince no one can fear that he knows not.</p>
            <pb n="233" facs="tcp:65680:136"/>
            <p>'Tis as Natural to Dye as to be Born; and to a Child, perhaps, one is as pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as the other. To return from whence we came, what Burthen, what Grief is it, or what pain? 'Tis but the ſame Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney we have made from Death, <hi>viz.</hi> from nothing to Life, without fear, without Paſſion, which we will make again from life to death. 'Tis no more, 'tis the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>Nay, 'tis the Birth-day of Eternity, which we fear as our laſt, and carries us from that Death that began in our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb, to the life that ſhall never end. We ſhall then ſee the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens together, and the glory thereof in its due place, which we can now ſee but darkly, through the narrow paſſages of our optick Nerves afar off. Inſtead of taking us from our ſelves, it ſets us at liberty, and makes us free to our ſelves. Inſtead of bringing us into darkneſs, it takes it from us, and gives us a larger light, our Intellectuals.</p>
            <p>You ſee then, there is nothing in Death that's terrible, or fearful. Diſeaſes,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65680:137"/>
Sighs, Groans, gaſtly looks, Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Friends and Allies, that make it ſeem dreadful, are but the Mask and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard under which Death is only hid and veild.</p>
            <p>'Tis great cowardize, then, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to fear it. To what end have Men Reaſon and Wiſdom given them, but to help them in a good Action? They ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing, if they cannot do more with them than a Fool doth with his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and, which time performeth in a fool, and in the weakeſt Sex too.</p>
            <p>But, to lay aſide Wiſdome and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; 'tis worth our remark, there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Paſſion, before ſpoken of, ſo weak, but it clearly vanquiſheth the fear of Death. And therefore Death is no ſuch kill-cow, ſuch an Hector, ſuch a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemy. Honour and Glory aſpire to it; Love contemns it; Grief and Deſpair purſue it; Revenge carries it Captive; &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To fear Death, then, is to be an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to thy ſelf, and Life; ſince no man
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65680:137"/>
can live at eaſe that fears to dye. 'Tis a madneſs to trouble thy life with the fear of Death, and thy Death with the care of life; he is only a free-man that fears it not; Nay, life it ſelf is but a ſlavery, if it were not made free by Death.</p>
            <p>Our lives would be a burthen, ſhould they not end in Death; if it were quite taken from us, we ſhould deſire it more than now we fear it: who would not dye to avoid the toyl and vexatious trouble of doing the ſame thing every day, and all the dayes of his life over again?</p>
            <p>Nay, 'tis unjuſt to fear Death; for, if it be good, why do we fear it? if evil, why do we make it worſe, and add evil to evil?</p>
            <p>Since it is an obligation muſt be paid, the time and place uncertain where it will attend us; lets therefore attend it in all places, and be ever ready to receive it.</p>
            <p>'Tis a vain thing, then, to pretend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to dye, becauſe of thy Youth,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65680:138"/>
flower, and ſtrength; 'tis fatal to great and glorious Perſons not to live long. Great Virtue, and long life ſeldom go together. Life is meaſured by the end, and if that be good, the quantity adds nothing to its perfection.</p>
            <p>Conſider, why art thou loath to leave the World? Haſt thou not ſeen all? One day is like another; there is no other light, nor other night. You ſee the World is made up only of a company of Fools and Knaves. Once in a few years, if it be well obſerved, you will find the years fall out the ſame as formerly; the ſame weather, as great Rains, as great Froſts, as great Droughts, as great Plenty, as great ſcarcity, as cool Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, as warm Winters; 'tis but the ſame over again, one year is like another, and there is nothing new under the <hi>Sun.</hi> So that he that has lived thirty, or five and thirty years, ſhall ſee as much as if he had lived five and thirty thouſand. 'Tis one and the ſame <hi>Sun,</hi> the ſame courſe of the World.</p>
            <p>If thou leaveſt Parents and Friends,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65680:138"/>
thou art going to more, and theſe ſhall quickly follow thee. If thou leaveſt ſmall Children, what then? Are they more thine, than Gods? Does not he, think you, love them beſt that loved them firſt? How many ſuch have come to greater preferment than other men?</p>
            <p>'Tis an excellent thing, therefore, to be prepared for Death at all times; and to end our lives before our Death, that our ſins may dye before our ſelves; that when we come to dye we may have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to do. <hi>This is an Honourable Death, and becoming a</hi> Gentleman. <hi>This is the true Bed of Honour indeed. For, to dye well, is to dye willingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Againſt the unlawful raſh deſire of Death.</note>As we ſhould not fear, ſo we ſhould not <hi>Deſire Death.</hi> 'Tis injuſtice, and to be out of Charity with the World, which our lives may benefit. 'Tis ingratitude to Nature not to prize life, and improve it to the beſt advantage, ſince 'tis ſo freely beſtowed on us. Yet ſo, as, if need be, to contemn Death: for that's the way to make thy life free.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65680:139"/>
If thou canſt not contemn Death, thou ſhalt never perform any glorious Act; but rather expoſe thy ſelf to many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers. For while thou art ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to preſerve thy ſelf thou hazzardeſt thine Honour, Virtue, and Honeſty. The contempt of Death produces the moſt Honourable exploits, whether in good or evil. He that fears not Death fears nothing; for he can do what he will, and is maſter both of his own, and anothers life.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">That the ſelf-murther of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other Nations, was rather puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity and Cowardize, than Magnanimity, and Courage.</note>I know, the wiſeſt were wont to ſay, That <hi>a Wiſe Man liveth as long as he ſhould, not ſo long as he can.</hi> Death being no more at his command, and in his power, than Life.
